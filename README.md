Now that you are on the main screen of the ToDoList application you can interact with it
in several ways:

* This is the title, pressing once on it will reverse the display order or swype it back
to it's default. By default, the tasks are listed from the latest date to the oldest one.
You can know wether it's in default mode or not looking at the title, in default mode, the
title is not reversed.
